<H3 align="center"><FONT color="#ff0000">What's new in Ver. 1.0:</FONT></H3>

<UL>

  <LI>Support for kerning

  <LI>Latest version (1.3.1) of the FreeType library used

  <LI>Times New Roman is mapped to Tms Rmn - you can remove the ATM version

  <LI>Few bugs fixed

  <LI>Several entirely new, unexpected and amusing bugs probably added...

</UL>

<P>

<B>FreeType/2</B> is an OS/2 TrueType Font Driver DLL based on the FreeType

engine. It replaces IBM's TRUETYPE.DLL in Warp 4, but it can be installed

on older versions of OS/2 too - but <A href="#warning">see below</A>!<BR>

<BR>

Some features of FreeType/2

<UL>

  <LI>Seamless integration with OS/2.

  <LI>Supports outlines for further glyph manipulation

  <LI>Supports national characters (if provided in the font). Now works with

all Latin and Cyrillic languages and Greek. Other languages are being worked

on (esp. Chinese, Japanese and Korean).<BR>

Traditional Chinese should work. <FONT color="#ff0000">NEW</FONT>

  <LI>Kerning now supported, although not extensively tested <FONT color="#ff0000">NEW</FONT>

  <LI>Works with older releases of OS/2, but <A href="#warning">see below</A>!!

  <LI>It's free

  <LI>And last but not least, it looks great!

</UL>

<P>

And some limitations of the current version:

<UL>

  <LI>No grayscaling a.k.a. antialiasing. Actually the FreeType engine supports

it, but the OS/2 Graphics Engine doesn't. If you really want this, tell

IBM. I can add this feature in about five minutes then (if the interface

is OK).<BR>

<SMALL>Note: It might help if your uncle is manager of one of those large

banks with zillions of OS/2 licenses. He should be able to convince IBM

easily &lt;grin&gt; </SMALL><BR>

More about antialiasing: Things have started moving on this front very

recently but right now I absoultely can't say if or when anything might

happen so don't hold your breath.

  <LI>Only partial support for DBCS languages. I'm working on it, but I have

no idea how long it will take before it's complete.

</UL>

<P>

The source code for the OS/2 font driver is part of the FreeType distribution

which is available <A href="../download.html#freetype1">here</A> in case you're interested.

<P>

Binary packages, with simple install/uninstall scripts are available <A href="../download.html#ftos2">here</A>.

<P>

Before installing FreeType/2, you'd certainly like to see FreeType/2 in

action.<BR>

Click <A href="diff.png">here</A> to see the difference between the original

Font Driver and FreeType/2 (both portions of text use Times New Roman at

12 pt).<BR>

<A href="ns.png">Here</A> you can see what this very page looked like at

the time of first Beta.<BR>

Note: FreeType/2 is compared to TRUETYPE.DLL form Warp 4 GA here. The latest

version (FP5 and later) gives a lot better results, but it is still no

match for FreeType/2.

<P>

Installation is quite simple, just run the approppriate REXX script. It

is very advisable to archive your system files first although there <I>shouldn't</I>

be problems.<BR>

It is a good practice to make regular backups of system files. I usually

don't and then I'm always sorry :-)<BR>

For more info please see the included README.TXT and the <A href="ft2faq.html">FAQ</A>.

<P>

There are two versions of the package, one for OS/2 Warp 3 and 4 and the

other for OS/2 2.1 (possibly even 2.0). Actually the 2.1 version works

fine on OS/2 Warp, the only difference is different compression used for

the DLL (i.e. the 2.1 version is a little bigger).

<P>

<A name="warning"></A> Note: because Warp 4 (preferably with FP5 or above)

has full international support, it is now the target platform. But this

doesn't mean that FreeType/2 won't run on Warp 4 GA or Warp 3! It only

means you won't be able to use, say, Korean fonts on your Warp US. You

might also run into problems if you use certain exotic fonts. If so, let

me know!<BR>

Please note that to use Times New Roman MT 30 or other large Unicode fonts

on Warp 3 you probably need to install one of the later fixpacks. You should

also have the required functionality if you have Java 1.1 installed.<BR>

Note: The OS/2 2.1 version hasn't been updated. If that's a problem for

you, don't hesitate to <A href="mailto:os2@freetype.org">mail</A>!

<P>

Bug reports, Comments and Suggestions can be sent to <A href="mailto:os2@freetype.org">os2@freetype.org</A>.<BR>

Of course try to read the available documentation (FAQ, README) before

you complain.

<P>

Simple greetings can also be sent directly to me at : <A href="mailto:mike@freetype.org">mike@freetype.org</A>

:-)

<P>

<B>FREETYPE/2 can now be downloaded <A href="../download.html#ftos2">HERE</A>.

</B> Enjoy !

<P>

My big thanks go to:<BR>

<B>David Turner</B>, the brain behind FreeType, for his hard work without

any compensation other than making the world a better place ;-)<BR>

<B>IBM</B>, the company we love to hate, for their imperfect TrueType driver

and for making all the necessary tools and documentation available publicly

and free of charge.<BR>

<B>Marc L Cohen</B>, <B>Ken Borgendale</B> and <B>Tetsuro Nishimura</B>

from IBM for providing me with lots of information I could never obtain

otherwise. Without them I'd never get this far.

&quot;OS/2 is dead? Again? Thanks for telling me, I'd never notice!&quot;
