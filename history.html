          <h3>FreeType&nbsp;1</h3>

          <p>The main author of FreeType was David Turner, who created
            the library in 1996 to render TrueType fonts, including an
            interpreter for handling TrueType bytecode.  It was
            originally written in
            the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29">Pascal</a>
            programming language.  In 1997, Robert Wilhelm ported it
            to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">C</a>,
            and Werner Lemberg joined the team.  Originally, the C and
            Pascal versions were developed in parallel, however,
            development of the Pascal version stopped in 2000.</p>

          <p>Using
            <a href="miscellaneous.html#freetype1">FreeType&nbsp;1</a>,
            as this original version is called today, some programs
            were written which then had some impact, for
            example <a href="ft_os2/index.html">FreeType/2</a>, a
            better TrueType font driver for
            the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os/2">OS/2</a>
            operating system,
            or <a href="http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/ttf2pk/">ttf2pk</a>,
            a converter from TrueType fonts
            to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</a>'s PK
            bitmap format (this program is still part
            of <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeXLive</a>).</p>

          <p>Robert Wilhelm stopped working on FreeType in 2000.</p>

        <div id="freetype2">
          <h3>FreeType&nbsp;2</h3>

          <p>After several beta releases, version 2.0 of FreeType was
            released in 2000, providing a complete rewrite to make it
            modular.  To distinguish it from FreeType&nbsp;1, it was
            then called FreeType&nbsp;2 (which is no longer necessary
            today).  Most important new features were the support of
            multiple font formats, in particular PostScript fonts
            (together with hinting engine), a much improved rendering
            backend for gray-level images, and a module for caching
            glyphs images and glyph metrics.  Later versions added
            support for even more font formats and LCD rendering
            modes.</p>

          <p>In the year 1999 we were informed by Apple Inc. that
            FreeType was infringing patents related to TrueType
            hinting (see <a href="patents.html">here</a> for more).
            As a consequence, we disabled the bytecode interpreter
            completely by default.  Later on we were able to refine
            this radical cut by disabling only the patented
            instructions, handling more than 95% of the other
            instructions just fine and circumventing problems with the
            remaining 5% to a certain extent.  Another consequence was
            the invention of the auto-hinter which needs no hints at
            all (you can
            find <a href="http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb24-3/lemberg.pdf">here</a>
            an early scholarly paper).  Today, the TrueType patents
            have expired.</p>

          <p>Around 2004 it was decided to restrict FreeType to a
            single target: Creating (rasterized) glyph images.
            Attempts to handle OpenType layout features and text
            shaping were abandoned since this could be handled much
            better with a separate library on top of FreeType
            (cf. <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/">ICU</a> or
            <a href="http://harfbuzz.org">Harfbuzz</a>).

          <p>In 2009, the source code repository has been migrated
            from <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>
            to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, and David Turner
            stopped active development on FreeType.  Since then the
            only maintainer is Werner Lemberg, with the help of others
            who contribute fixes and improvements.</p>
