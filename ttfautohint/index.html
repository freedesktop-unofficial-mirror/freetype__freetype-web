          <h4>8th March 2013</h4>

          <p>Today I've released version 0.95.  This is a small
            maintainance release without major news
            (see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.95/">here</a>
            for more).</p>

          <p>Currently, I'm heavily working on FreeType (including
            payed work) without having much time to continue the
            development of ttfautohint.  I estimate that this dormant
            phase will end in about two months, so stay tuned!</p>

          <h4>28th November 2012</h4>

          <p>This time, I have two issues to talk about:</p>

          <ul style="list-style: circle">
            <li>
              <p>Version 0.94 is out.  It adds two new options to
                better control the vertical dimensions of hinted
                glyphs to avoid clipping on Windows in case
                the <tt>usWinAscent</tt> and <tt>usWinDescent</tt>
                values from the font's &lsquo;OS/2&rsquo; table can't
                be adjusted (for whatever reasons).  As usual,
                look <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.94/">here</a>
                for more information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In the last twelve months, there was a lot of
                progress in the development of ttfautohint.  However,
                there is still a large list of improvements I would
                like to work on so that this tool becomes more
                versatile and useful.  To make this happen I start
                <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/15816">a new
                  funding drive</a>, and I ask you for financial
                  support!</p>
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h4>10th October 2012</h4>

          <p>Here comes version 0.93, right in time for the talk given
            by <a href="mailto:dave@understandingfonts.com">Dave
            Crossland</a> and <a href="mailto:eben@eyebytes.com">Eben
            Sorkin</a> at
            the <a href="http://www.atypi.org/hong-kong-2012/programme/11-oct-type-technologies-workshops/activity?a=148">atypi
            conference in Hong Kong!</a></p>

          <p>On the functionality side, it brings
            a <a href="doc/ttfautohint.html#hint-with-components">new
            option</a> to hint composite glyphs differently, greatly
            reducing the bytecode size of the created hints.  I'm
            waiting for reports whether this option works for most
            fonts; in case this is true I'll make it the default.  So
            please test!</p>

          <p>The list of other changes can be
            found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.93/">here</a>.
            Among other things, the GUI version of ttfautohint has a
            new layout (based on suggestions
            from <a href="mailto:frederik@typemytype.com">Frederik
            Berlaen</a>).</p>

          <div style="text-align: center;
                      margin-top: 2em">

          </div>


          <h4>7th August 2012</h4>

          <p>I've found quite an embarassing bug in the bytecode
            produced by ttfautohint, causing bad rounding.  All users
            should upgrade to version 0.92.</p>


          <h4>12th July 2012</h4>

          <p>Version 0.91 is out!  This mainly brings better support
            for GDI ClearType.  For other, minor improvements, please
            go
            to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.91/">this
            page</a> for more.</p>


          <h4>7th June 2012</h4>
          <p>After a long hiatus due to personal reasons, followed by
            intensive work on
            the <a href="doc/ttfautohint.html">documentation</a>, I'm
            happy to release version 0.9.</p>

          <p>While I was able to significantly reduce the generated
            bytecode, the GDI issues haven't been solved yet,
            unfortunately, to be fixed in a forthcoming release.  For
            other, minor improvements, please go
            to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.9/">this
            page</a> for more.</p>


          <h4>6th April 2012</h4>

          <p>Thanks to a very generous donation from
            <a href="http://blog.webink.com/extensis-webink-funds-open-source-ttfautohint-better-fonts-on-screen/">Extensis
              WebINK</a>,
              my <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/15816">pledgie
              campaign</a> has reached its goal.  Kudos to all of you
              who have donated and supported me!</p>

          <p>In a few weeks I'll do a new release; this time with
            smaller output fonts due to a reduced size of the
            generated bytecode, and with better support for GDI
            ClearType.</p>


          <h4>30th March 2012</h4>

          <p>This page now uses
            the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html">Roboto</a>
            font for display.</p>

          <p>Karsten L&uuml;cke again provided
            a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.8/ttfautohint-0.8-tty-osx.tar.gz/download">static

            for OS&nbsp;X.</p>


          <h4>21st March 2012</h4>

          <p>Version 0.8 is available.</p>

          <p>This release brings various minor improvements; see
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.8/">this
              page</a> for more.</p>

          <p>To whet your appetite: Here is a snapshot of the
          GUI&nbsp;:-)</p>

          <div style="text-align: center;

          <p><a href="#download">Below</a> you can find a link for
            downloading Windows binaries.  If you want to have better
            installation support (including a package for Mac), please
            donate!</p>


          <h4>2nd January 2012</h4>

          <p>Version 0.6.1 is available.</p>

          <p>This release should fix problems with version 0.6;
            additionally, dropout mode has been activated.</p>


          <h4>25th December 2011</h4>

          <p>My Xmas present to you: version 0.6.  Thanks to all of
            you who are still donating!</p>

          <p>This version greatly improves handling of composite
            glyphs.  It also implements option <tt>-p</tt> to pre-hint
            a font with the original hints before processing it.</p>


          <h4>19th November 2011</h4>

          <p>Karsten L&uuml;cke provided a
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.5/ttfautohint-0.5-osx/download">static
              binary for OS&nbsp;X</a> &ndash; no need to install
              FreeType!  It was generated under version 10.5.8, but
              should run with version 10.7 also.</p>


          <h4>9th November 2011</h4>

          <p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Web
              Fonts</a> has contributed an additional $3,000!  I have
              now raised two thirds of my goal!</p>

          <p>I hope other corporate font developers, especially those
            with large font catalogs, who will benefit substantially
            from this work, will consider making a contribution of a
            thousand dollars.</p>

          <p>I have just released version 0.5, including a Windows binary.
            <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/ttfautohint.git/blob/HEAD:/TODO">You
              can read the project roadmap here.</a></p>


          <h4>18th October 2011</h4>

          <p>In September we have raised over $2,000 from the public,
            $7,000 each from Google and
            <a href="http://www.fontlab.com">FontLab</a>, together
            with a copy of FontLab&nbsp;5, and received from Microsoft
            the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/vtt.htm">
            Visual TrueType</a> file format specification.  This will
            allow designers to refine ttfautohint's results further
            using VTT, if I reach my $30,000 goal!</p>

          <p>The collected money so far enables me to intensively work
            on ttfautohint for the next three months.  The two main
            issues I'm going to handle are</p>

          <ul style="list-style: circle">
            <li>
              <p>fixing the bytecode to make it work reliably with
                Apple's TrueType engines (I've already started with
                that, and I estimate to provide a new release in about
                two weeks)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>writing a GUI for easier control</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>In case you have special wishes, now it's the right time
            to tell me!  Please look into
            the <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/ttfautohint.git/blob/HEAD:/TODO"><tt>TODO</tt></a>
            file and check whether your idea is already covered!</p>

        <!-- ************************************************** -->

        <div id="introduction">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p><a href="mailto:wl@gnu.org">Werner Lemberg</a> is making
            it easy for type designers to create web fonts that look
            great on Windows, with <tt>ttfautohint</tt>.</p>

          <p>Hinting TrueType fonts can be a slow and expensive
            process, and many fonts lack good hinting totally because
            they are converted to TrueType from another font
            format.</p>

          <p><tt>ttfautohint</tt> solves this, by building on
            <a href="http://www.freetype.org">FreeType</a>'s
            autohinting system.  It brings the excellent quality of
            FreeType rendering to platforms which don't use FreeType,
            yet require hinting for text to look good &ndash; like
            Microsoft Windows.</p>

          <p>Across Windows rendering environments today,
            <tt>ttfautohint</tt> fonts look best with DirectWrite
            ClearType enabled. This is the default for Windows&nbsp;7.
            Good visual results are also seen in recent MacOS X
            versions and GNU/Linux systems that do use FreeType for
            rendering.  Work is now underway to improve quality of
            older Windows &lsquo;GDI&rsquo; rendering.</p>

          <p>The main part of the project is a code library, which is
            described in detail in the source code file
            <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/ttfautohint.git/blob/HEAD:/lib/ttfautohint.h"><tt>src/ttfautohint.h</tt></a>.
            There are utility programs with both command-line and GUI
            interfaces, <a href="#download">ready to use
            today</a>.</p>

          <p>The goal of the project is to generate a &lsquo;first
            pass&rsquo; of hinting that font developers can refine
            further for ultimate quality.</p>

          <div style="text-align: center;
                      margin-top: 2em">
            <img src="image/LiberationSerif-Regular-TA-dollar-19px.gif"
                 alt="animated dollar glyph of LiberationSerif-Regular"
                 width="407"
                 height="444">
          </div>

          <p>The animation above shows how the hints created
            by <tt>ttfautohint</tt> get applied to the dollar glyph of
            <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation
              Serif Regular</a> at 19&nbsp;pixels per em, using
            <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">FontForge</a>'s
            TrueType hinting bytecode debugger.  (You can view the
            image <a href="image/LiberationSerif-Regular-TA-dollar-19px.gif">directly</a>
            to see it in original size.)</p>
        </div>


        <!-- ************************************************** -->

        <div id="roadmap">
          <h2>Roadmap</h2>

          <p>The project started in 2010
            when <a href="http://understandingfonts.com/">Dave
              Crossland</a> suggested the idea of the program.  Werner was
            able to start development thanks to financial support from the
            <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/">Google Web
            Fonts</a> team.</p>

          <p>He soon produced results that received
            <a href="http://typophile.com/node/83829">some warm
              attention from professional type designers</a>.</p>

          <p>Werner is now working full time on the project while
            <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/15816"
               target="_blank">seeking financial support</a> from the
               wider typography community to continue this work.</p>

          <p>Hinting TrueType fonts is a very time consuming and
            expensive process for type designers.  Producing high
            quality hinting for most glyphs in a font, and allowing
            them to fine-tune the results by hand will simplify the
            lives of all type designers.  This little program is set
            to improve the quality of web typography!</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/ttfautohint.git/blob/HEAD:/TODO"><tt>TODO</tt></a>
            file in the source code repository provides an extensive
            list of things which will be eventually handled in one or
            another way.  Here is a short list of essential items:</p>

          <ul style="list-style: circle">
            <li>
              <p><strong>Add ways to fine-tune the results</strong>
                &ndash; finer control over blue zones and other
                details of the hinting process follow naturally after
                a GUI is in place.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Add full OpenType Feature support</strong>
                &ndash; currently, all glyphs which can't be directly
                addressed with a character code in the
                &lsquo;cmap&rsquo; table are handled with a fallback
                mechanism only.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Add support for all the world's writing
                  systems</strong> &ndash; since FreeType's autohinting
                system supports the Arabic and CJK (Chinese, Korean,
                Japanese) writing systems, <tt>ttfautohint</tt> could do
                so too.  (So far the primary goal is to make
                <tt>ttfautohint</tt> work well with the latin
                script.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Add hooks for other tools</strong> &ndash; to
                allow smooth integration with various font
                editors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Emit the actions in the high-level hinting
                  command languages</strong> &ndash; those used in other
                tools, such as
                <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/vtt.aspx">Visual
                  TrueType (VTT)</a> or
                <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/">FontLab</a>, instead
                of only emitting final low-level bytecode.  This will
                allow designers to fine tune the results by hand
                &ndash; essential for those tricky glyphs that require
                intelligent decisions by a human</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Make the library itself installable.</p>

          <h2>Visual Samples</h2>

          <p>Vernon Adams has done extensive testing
            of <tt>ttfautohint</tt>, and has documented this in detail
            over at his
            <a href="http://code.newtypography.co.uk/very-latest-ttfautohint-screenshots/">blog, <em>New
                Typography</em></a>.  While doing so, he created
                a <a href="http://cloud-fonts.com/screendump/ttfautohint-15july.zip">large
                set (ZIP)</a> of test images.  A few of them are shown
                below, with image descriptions always above an
                image:</p>

          <p>Ubuntu Regular, Windows DirectWrite ClearType:</p>

          <img src="image/ubuntu-2-DW.png"

          <p>Ubuntu regular, GDI ClearType.  This image clearly shows
            the aggressive colour filtering.
            With <tt>ttfautohint</tt>, curved outline extrema not
            aligned to a pixel border are not handled well, giving
            some sizes a bitmap-like appearance:</p>

               width="848"

          <p>Vera Regular, Windows DirectWrite ClearType:</p>

          <img src="image/vera-2-DW.png"
               alt="Vera Regular, Windows DirectWrite ClearType"
               width="851"

          <p>Finally, here two font files of
            <a href="http://font.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Regular</a> so
            that you can compare the hinting results by yourself:</p>

            <a href="Ubuntu-TTFautohint-R.ttf"><tt>Ubuntu-TTFautohint-R.ttf</tt></a></p>

          <p>Note that <tt>Ubuntu-TTFautohint-R.ttf</tt> has been
            generated with version&nbsp;0.5 of <tt>ttfautohint</tt>; it
            has also been manually edited (using
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/">ttx</a>)
            to change the font name so that it is possible to use the
            original version and the version processed
            with <tt>ttfautohint</tt> in parallel.</p>

        <div id="works">
          <h2 class="section">How It Works</h2>

          <p>A detailed description of the autohinter inside FreeType can
            be found
            <a href="../autohinting/hinter.html">here</a>.  Although
            these web pages are in need of an update, the basic
            principles of the autohinting process haven't changed.
            There is one exception: The autohinter no longer tries to
            provide good hinting for monochrome rasterization.
            Instead, it expects anti-aliasing with 256 gray levels,
            which became standard with Windows&nbsp;98.</p>

          <p>A scholarly paper published in the EuroTeX 2003 proceedings,
            titled
            <a href="http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb24-3/lemberg.pdf"><em>Real-Time
                Grid Fitting of Typographic Outlines</em></a>, gives
            further insight into the autohinting system's inner
            workings.</p>

          <p>In the above links, one aspect of the autohinting process is
            missing: The various steps performed by the autohinter (called
            <em>actions</em>) can be described as high-level
            operations, for example &ldquo;aligning a given edge to a
            given blue zone,&rdquo; or &ldquo;linking this edge to
            another one within a given distance.&rdquo;
            The <tt>ttfautohint</tt> library hooks into these actions
            and transforms them into bytecode routines.</p>

          <p>Similar to most TrueType hints, the autohint actions
            depend on the device resolution.
            Consequently, <tt>ttfautohint</tt> walks over a large
            range of ppem values (8&nbsp;to 1000&nbsp;ppem by default)
            and collects the actions as sets.  A typical glyph outline
            needs three to four sets (covering the whole range), but
            sometimes more than ten are necessary.</p>

          <p>Intentionally, <tt>ttfautohint</tt> adds hints only along
            the y-axis.
            The <a href="http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/">Anti-Grain
            research</a> describes some of the reasons behind this
            decision.  While the article is quite old, the mentioned
            ideas are still valid.</p>

          <p>The <tt>ttfautohint</tt> library contains a copy of
            FreeType's &lsquo;autofit&rsquo; module, reformatted and
            using a different function prefix, and with slight
            extensions for hooks into hinting actions.  It therefore
            inherits the same dual-licensing as FreeType; you can
            choose between the GNU Public License (GPL) Version&nbsp;2
            and the FreeType License (FTL.)</p>
