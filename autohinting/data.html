<p>This section contains various information, data & pointers related to
   existing glyph grid-fitting technologies.</p>

<a name="truetype"><h3>TrueType</h3></a>

<p>As described previously, the TrueType format associates to each glyph
   outline a bytecoded program written for a specific virtual processor
   specialized in geometric processing in the pixel space. Hence, the
   hints of a given glyph are really a program that is interpreted at
   run-time by a TrueType renderer. The program directly performs all
   grid-fitting operations on the scaled outline.</p>
   
<p>This incredible flexibility is what allows such high-quality fonts as
   those distributed by Microsoft. However this has its price. The intermediate
   bytecode used is pretty hard to write for, and only a very few number of
   people in the world are able to "speak" it fluently.</p>
   
<p>Most TrueType fonts are created with tools that try to automatically
   generate such programs from the hints they themselves provide, or those
   given by the font designer. Not all of these tools really produce good
   results, which is why, when TrueType first appeared, most of the fonts in
   this format had _very_ low quality on the screen. With time, the tools
   improved dramatically and it is now possible to create good-looking fonts
   relatively easily.</p>
   
<p>Theorically, TrueType <em>far exceeds</em> the capabilities of Type 1
   when it comes to rendering at low sizes, however it's high degree of
   technicality makes the design of good fonts a very lengthy process,
   actually longer than creating the equivalent good-looking Type 1 font.</p>

<p>The quality of final glyph images is completely determined by the glyph
   program, which means that several TrueType renderers should theorically
   produce the exact same results. However, rounding considerations and
   scan-conversion approximation (during drop-out control, for example)
   often produce really minor differences between engines.</p>

<p>TrueType is certainly the only technology that allows to hint glyphs in
   order to make them match <em>perfectly</em> hand-edited bitmap glyphs,
   though this can only done through a <em>very</em> long process, with
   very specialized tools. It is by far the technology that produces the best
   looking monochrome bitmaps.</p>

<p>Regarding anti-aliased glyphs, Windows and FreeType 1.x use similar
   algorithms that approximate each pixel coverage with only 5 levels of
   grays. At small pixel size, this is however noticeable when reading large
   portion of text. Most other engines, including FreeType 2, uses a higher
   level number of grays for finer details.</p>
   
   

<a name="type1"><h3>Type 1 / Type 2</h3></a>

<p>The hints in a Postscript Type 1 fonts are relatively simple compared to
   those of TrueType. They are however only suggestions given to the
   final renderer, and they more or less describe some aspects of the glyph
   or font.
   </p>

<p>This means that a Type 1 renderer must be smart enough to interpret them
   correctly to produce good results. Note also that, even though Type 1 hints
   are relatively easy to generate, a lot of Type 1 fonts available are
   poorly hinted.</p>

<p>Type 2 is an alternate glyph encoding format developed by Adobe for its
   CFF font format. It is more compact than Type 1 but contains basically the
   same hint information than Type 1.</p>

<p>The quality of the rendered glyphs is highly dependent on the final
   renderer's ability to interpret the hints or even align the outline
   without them..</p>

<p>Most Type 1 renderers do a poor-to-good job with hinting monochrome glyphs.
   However, it is often possible to generate good-looking anti-aliased glyphs
   with very few hints and "intelligence".</p>

<a name="metafont"><h3>MetaFont</h3>

<p>MetaFont is the digital type technology developped for TeX by Donald Knuth.
   It is based on strokes, rather than outlines, and describes each glyph in
   math terms. It is thus capable of parametric synthesis however.</p>
   
<p>Note that reader Matijs van Zuijlen recently a note regarding MetaFont's
   support of hinting:</p>
   
<font color="green"><pre>
  I just visited the FreeType Auto-Hinting pages, and decided to write a
  quick note to tell you that MetaFont does in fact provide ways to align
  outlines to the pixel grid. The method is described in detail in the
  MetaFont Book. One of the aims of MetaFont is to privide good-quality
  bitmaps for low resolution devices, though it was aimed more at printers
  than screens.
</pre></font>

<p>Indeed, the MetaFont book chapter 24 is named "Discreteness and Discretion"
   and deals with several ways to handle the pixel grid. However, the methods
   described there are a lot more cumbersome than what TrueType offers, and
   isn't capable of doing as much work.</p>

<a name="intellifont"><h3>Intellifont</h3></a>

<p>Intellifont is a font format and technology developed by Agfa, and part
   of HP's PCL 5 page description language. Since Agfa bought Monotype, it's
   hard to see references to this technology on their web pages. However,
   this <a href=" 
   </p>

<a name="infinifont"><h3>Infinifont</h3></a>

<p>Infinifont is a parametric font format based on strokes rather than outlines,
   a la Metafont. It is used by HP as a compression format as it is able to
   generate fonts based on their PANOSE numbers.</p>
   
<p>It is described in more or less details in this
   <a href="http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/volume6/issue3/beausol.pdf">
   old PDF article</a>. Note that it is stroke-based, like MetaFont.
   </p>

<a name="truedoc"><h3>TrueDoc</h3></a>

<p>TrueDoc is a proprietary font format developped by BitStream. Its
   specification is now publicly available as part of the
   <a href="http://www.davic.org">Digital Audio-Video Council</a>
   specification. It can be found in
   <a href="ftp://ftp.davic.org/Davic/Pub/Spec1_4/14p09ml.pdf">
   Annex A of this PDF Document</a>. Note that the format is covered by the
   following <a href="http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?pn=US05099435__">
   patent</a>. TrueDoc is a derivative of the Speedo Bitstream font format
   (used for example in the X11 font server).</p>

<p>The TrueDoc hints are very similar to the ones found in a Type 1 font.
   However, the "innovation" here comes in the way they are stored and also
   used to encode the outlines in the font. Basically, rendering a hinted
   TrueDoc outline needs to: first decode the hints and adjust them to the
   pixel grid, then load each outline element and _directly_ scale and grid-fit
   it using the adjusted hints.</p>
   
<p>The TrueDoc file format itself, although highly messy, is compact and well
   suited to fast glyph decoding/rendering. The rendering quality of glyph
   images is however very dependent on the final renderer and the hints
   provided in the fonts.</p>
   
<p>Curious users can have a look at the
   <a href="http://www.truedoc.com">TrueDoc Site</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The TrueDoc hints do not deal with diagonals, which unfortunately shows
   a lot in the following image (taken from the TrueDoc site) where monochrome
   glyphs are generated:</p>
   
<center><img src="image/truedoc_mono.png" width=413 height=225></center>

<!--
<p>On the other hand, anti-aliased images seem better, as expected, though far
   from being excellent (can you see the "w" coming to you :-):</p>

<center><img src="image/truedoc_antialias.png"></center>

<a name="d-type"><h3>D-Type</h3></a>

<p>D-Type is a scalable graphics library that includes its own font engine.
   There is little information on it, except at their web site. Their engine
   is capable or real-time automatic hinting, though they advertise their own
   D-Type font format, <em>which includes</em> hints !?.</p>
   
<p>Apparently, D-Type doesn't generate monochrome glyphs, only anti-aliased
   ones. The results seem very impressive however. See this
  <a href="http://dtype.yy.net/autohint.htm">this image</a> for an example.</p>


<p>More details can be found on the
   <a href="http://dtype.yy.net/type.htm">DType Font Engine Web Site</a></p>

<a name="t2k"><h3>T2K</h3></a>

<p>T2K is a font engine developed by Sampo Kaasila, the original lead TrueType
   designer at Apple. His company, named Type Solutions Inc., was bought by
   BitStream in December 1998, and the engine has been revamped and renamed
   Font Fusion.</p>

<p>More information is available on the <a href="http://www.typesolutions.com">
   Type Solutions web site</a>. Notwithstanding the incredibly biased and hyped
   information given at its site, T2K/Font Fusion seems to produce very good
   results by automatically hinting fonts in real-time.</p>

<p><em>T2K seems to have been licensed to Sun for Java. This could mean that its
   source code, or part of it, could be available under the SCSL, though I
   didn't take the time to download that _whole_ package. Anyone interested
   in finding out if its there ??</em></p>

<p>Apparently, T2K is able to generate auto-hinted monochrome images, though
   they provide absolutely no screenshots of these. Their anti-aliased images
   however seem at least as good as D-Type's.</p>

<p>It is clear that both D-Type and T2K set the bar for anti-aliased rendering,
   and we will try to at least match their quality in our own module. As for
   monochrome hinting, it certainly will be a challenge to get right :-)</p>

<a name="hobby"><h3>John Hobby's Paper</h3></a>

<p>To be written. Briefly, I know about John Hobby's paper and have read
   and analyzed it heavily. I'll post my detailed impressions on it a bit
   later. Meanwhile, please do not send me references to this paper twice
   a week, thanks ;-)</p>

<a name="epfl"><h3>EPFL auto-hinting</h3></a>

<p>The Peripheral Systems Laboratory department of the Ecole Polytechnique
   de Lausanne has a patent on a method they call
   <a href="http://diwww.epfl.ch/w3lsp/research/typography/grayscale/">
   Perceptually-Tuned Grayscale Characters</a> which is nothing more than
   a auto-hinting scheme used to improve the legibility/quality of glyphs.</p>
   
<p>Note that this technique is describe by this
   <a href="http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?pn=US05796409__">patent</a> and
   this <a href="http://diwww.epfl.ch/w3lsp/publications/grayscale//ptggf.html">
   publication</a>.</p>
   
<p>The department has produced other interesting publications on the topic
   of Digital Type and auto-hinting. For example :</p>
   
<p class="center"><a href="http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/volume7/issue4/ep125jh.pdf">
Towards a universal auto-hinting system for typographic shapes
</a></p>
   
   

<a name="ttf2pt1"><h3>TTF2PT1</h3></a>

<p>To be written. This is an open-source TrueType to Type 1 converter that
   apparently good hints when creating font files (unlike our own TTF2PFB
   which completely ignores them..).</p>
