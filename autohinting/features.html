<h2 align=center>Feature Detection in FreeType 2</h2>
</td></tr><tr><td>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This section documents the <em>feature detection</em> pass of the
   FreeType Auto-Hinter. This pass is in charge of detecting important
   glyph features that will need special processing when aligning the
   outline to the pixel grid, mainly stems, serifs as well as point
   candidates for blue zone alignment. It is performed on the unscaled
   master outline of a glyph.</p>


<h3>Prior analysis</h3>

<p>Each new glyph that is loaded in the auto-hinter is scanned to compute
   important information associated to each of its points. Mainly, these
   are: </p>
   
<p><ul>
   <li><p>the point coordinates in the master outline, and its scaled
          coordinates in pixel space. There is also some room for the
          grid-fitted coordinate that are later computed.</p>
            
   <li><p>the angles of the inwards and outwards tangents on each point
          (this is performed through a very quick look-up table used to
          implement the "arctan" function with reduced accuracy).</p>
          
   <li><p>pointers to the next and previous points in the same contour.
          this is later used to scan the glyph more easily in latter
          passes.</p>
          
   <li><p>flags indicating the point's type. The flags will be later
          adjusted.</p>
</ul></p>

<h3>Segment detection and linkage</h3>

<p>The Auto-Hinter first tries to detect <em>segments</em>. A segment is
   simply a set of successive points aligned either on the horizontal or
   vertical direction. Each segment has a direction, depending on the contour that
   includes it.</p>

<p><em>Note that we do not try, for now, to detect and manage diagonal stems.
   However, this will be added later with a very similar scheme.</em></p>

<p>Then, segments are linked together, in order to recognize vertical or
   horizontal "stems". Basically, two segments can be linked when they delimit
   a "span" during the scan-conversion process. Basically, this means :</p>
        
<p><ul>
   <li><p>they are both aligned on the same axis, and have opposite
          directions.</p>
     
   <li><p>in TrueType, outlines are filled to the right of the contour's
          direction. This means that if the segments are vertical, the
          upwards segment must be located to the left of the downwards
          segment.</p>
     
   <li><p>Similarly, for TrueType, if the segments are horizontal, the
          leftwards segment must be placed below the rightwards one.</p>
     
   <li><p>For Type 1, which uses the opposite filling convention, inverse
          rules must be applied. This means that we need to know in advance
          what's the filling rule used in an outline.</p>
 </ul></p>

<p>Each segment is linked to the "closest" linkable segment. We do this
   by scoring the "distance" between two segments, and keeping the one
   with the lowest score. The scoring function must be simple and reflects
   basically the "distance" between the segments.</p>

<p>Then when two segments are linked "together", i.e. when we have
   (seg1->link == seg2 && seg2->link == seg1), they form a vertical or
   horizontal "stem". On the other hand, when (seg1->link == seg2
   && seg2->link != seg1), then seg1 is said to be a "serif" segment, and we
   put the value (seg2->link) in its field (seg1->serif) to indicate this.</p>

<p>a segment is said to be "rounded" when either one of its extrema
   points is off the outline (cubic control point).</p>

   
<h3>Edge detection and linkage</h3>

<p>Segments that are located on the same coordinate, or close enough from
   each other are grouped in <em>edges</em>. An edge is simply an axis
   coordinate that contains one or more segments on it. Each edge inherits
   the properties of its segments, following a few simple rules:</p>

<p><ul>
   <li>an edge that contains a stem segment is a stem edge
   <li>an edge that only contains serif segments is a serif edge
   <li>an edge that only contains rounded segments is a rounded edge
</ul></p>

<p>Note that similarly to segments, we can link edges together, and find
   "stem" edges, as well as "serif" edges. This information is later used
   by the control alignment phase, as edges are the basis of grid-alignement
   and point interpolation in the FreeType Auto-Hinter.</p>

<h3>Blue edge detection</h3>

<p>It is also necessary to detect which edges need to be aligned against
   a bottom or top blue zone. This is performed after edge detection and
   linkage with some simple rules:</p>

<p><ul>
   <li><p>Only right-wards edges are linked against a top blue zone, and
          left-wards ones are linked against a bottom blue zone (this is for
          TrueType, invert the right/left direction for Type&nbsp;1).</p>
       
   <li><p>Each such edge is compared to the zone's reference position,
          and linked against it if it is close enough.</p>
          
   <li><p>Moreover, if the edge is rounded, it is also compared to the zone's
          overshoot position and linked against it when closer than to the
          reference.</p>
          
   <li><p>To avoid weird artefacts, a round edge may NOT be snapped to a blue
          position when it is under the reference point.</p>
</ul></p>
