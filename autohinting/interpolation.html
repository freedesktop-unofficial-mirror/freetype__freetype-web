<h2>Introduction & Background:</h2>


<p>As described before, the FreeType 2 Auto-hinter computes segments and
   edges to model stems and serifs in a given glyph. Edges are grid-fitted
   relative to each other in order to ensure low distorsion while ensuring
   stem width normalization.</p>
   
<p>When this first step of alignment control is achieved, points of the glyph
   outlines must be moved to a new position, depending on their coordinates
   relative to the edges. For example, all the points that are part of a segment
   or an edge are moved to the segment/edge's new position, directly.</p>

<p>There are however several ways to position/interpolate the remaining points,
   and they will be explained here. Each interpolation scheme happens in a
   single dimension at a time. For the sake of clarity, we will consider that
   we are moving points in the horizontal direction, relative to vertical
   edges.</p>
   
<h2>Strong Interpolation</h2>

<p>In the master/font outline, a point that is located between two edges
   has a coordinate that can be considered a weighted average of its
   surrounding edge's positions. Strong interpolation consists simply in
   reproducing this relationship in pixel space, using the grid-fitted
   position of edges.</p>

<p>More technically, the point's pixel position will be the same weigthed
   average of the grid-fitted edge's positions, using the formula:</p>
   
<ul>
<pre>
   p    the point to be interpolated
   a    the edge before the point
   b    the edge after the point
   
   grid-fitted coordinates are marked with a (')
   
   p.x' = a.x' + ( p.x - a.x ) * ( b.x' - a.x' )/( b.x - a.x )
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Also, all points that are before the first edge will be shifted by a
   distance that corresponds to the edge displacement between its scaled
   and grid-fitted coordinate. Similarly, each point that is adter the
   last edge will be shifted by a similar distance computed for the last
   edge.</p>

<p>Note that strong interpolation is equivalent to the TrueType "IP"
   instruction (which isn't patented btw).</p>

<p>Strong interpolation works wonders when it interpolates sections
   of glyphs that are contained within two edges. However, it can unpleasantly
   transform sections that span over more than two edges. For example, the
   contour of the "9" in the following image is "broken", given that some of
   its control points are incorrectly interpolated (horizontal edges displayed):</p>
   
<p><center><img src="image/strong_nine.png"></center></p>

<p>Moreover, it is pretty ignorant of the general shape of the glyph and
   its contours, which can lead to incorrect alignments in the case of
   overlapping stems positions, as demonstrated by the top dot of the
   semi-column in the following picture (vertical edges displayed):</p>

<p><center><img src="image/strong_semi_column.png"></center></p>


<h2>Weak Interpolation</h2>

<p>Weak interpolation is very similar to strong interpolation, with the
   exception that instead of taking the position of surrounding edges to
   compute a weighted average, it takes for each point, the position of
   the previous and next <em>contour</em> points that have been already
   "touched".</p>

<p>When only one point of the contour is touched, then the whole contour is
   shifted. When no point of the contour is touched, the contour doesn't
   move from its scaled position.</p>
   
<p>Weak interpolation works wonders when all extrema points lie on segments
   and edges. However, it has many weaknesses when this condition isn't met.
   For example, the following picture shows an "8" whose points have been
   weak-interpolated (horizontal edges displayed):</p>

<p><center><image src="image/weak_eight.png"></center></p>

<p>The problem here is that the inside contours have been simply shifted when
   the top and bottom stems of the "8" have been aligned. This is due to the
   fact that only one of their points is touched for each of them.
   Unfortunately, each inside contour has a
   vertical extremum that seems to need to be strong-interpolated.
   Weak interpolation is thus a technique that cannot be used alone.</p>

<p>Note that weak interpolation is equivalent to the TrueType "IUP" instruction,
   which isn't patented. Actually, most TrueType glyph programs hint a glyph
   through a series of edge alignment + strong interpolation, and call IUP
   to interpolate the remaining points as the last instruction before the
   hand-edited delta instructions.</p>

<h2>Interpolation in FreeType 2</h2>

<p>Well, as you may have already guessed :o), we use a combination of these two
   techniques when interpolating point in the FreeType 2 auto-hinter.</p>
   
<p>To be exact, we select which interpolation to apply depending on each
   point's status, given that not all points are equal. Actually, given
   that the artefacts of strong interpolation are mostly noticeable when
   we interpolate bezier control points as well as on-points that
   define the junction of two tangent arcs or segments, we simply
   preferably weak-interpolate such points, leaving the others to
   strong interpolation. We also perform strong interpolation before
   weak interpolation.</p>
   
<p>This means the following scheme:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li><p>Find all conic or cubic control points and tag them as candidates
         for weak interpolation.</p>
         
  <li><p>For all other points, compute the inwards and outwards angles of
         the contour on this point. When the difference between these
         angles is small, marks the point as a candidate for weak
         interpolation.</p>

  <li><p>Hint the edges, then scan the glyph to moved all edge points to
         their new position. Mark such points as "done".</p>
         
  <li><p>Re-scan the glyph to move all non-edge points that were not
         detected previously as "weak" candidates, and strong-interpolate
         them. Mark such points as "done".</p>
  
  <li><p>If there are points left, weak-interpolate them using the "done"
         flag of each contour point to compute the weak "bounds" in each
         point.</p>
</ul></p>
