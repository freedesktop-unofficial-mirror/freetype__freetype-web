<p><br>
   Fonts are usually stored in a font file as a series of vectorial shapes
   called <em>outlines</em>. Each outline is defined as a series of points
   in what is called the <em>master</em> or <em>EM</em> space. Points can
   be tagged to indicate that they are actually <em>on</em> the curve, or
   alternatively, conic or cubic bezier control points. In the latter case,
   they are called <em>off</em> points.</p>

<p>In order to render a glyph to a given character size, the outline is scaled
   from the master space to the device space using a simple scaling transform.
   This scaled outline can then be converted into a monochrome bitmap, or an
   anti-aliased one. However, such glyphs displayed on a low-resolution surface
   will often show numerous unpleasant artifacts. Here is an example of 
   simply-scaled text :</p>

<center><img src="image/scaled_cascade.png" width=494 height=155></center>
   
<p>As you can see, this text suffers from the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
   <li><p>stem widths and heights are not consistent, even in a single
          character image</p>
          
   <li><p>the top and bottom of certain characters do not seem to align
          with the top or bottom of others.</p>
          
   <li><p>curves and diagonals are generally ugly..</p>
</ul>

<a name="grid-fitting"><h3>Grid-Fitting</h3></a>

<p>Grid-Fitting is the general process of modifying glyph outlines in order
   to align some of their important features to the pixel grid in device
   space. When done correctly, the quality of the final glyph bitmaps is
   massively improved. Here is an example of the <em>same</em> text with
   all glyph outlines grid-fitted by a TrueType renderer:</p>
   
<center><img src="image/hinted_cascade.png" width=492 height=147></center>

<p>The difference is indeed striking.</p>

<a name="hinting"><h3>Hinting</h3></a>

<p>Grid-fitting can be decomposed in two important phases :</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Feature Detection</b><br>
         This pass is in charge of detecting important glyph and font
         features and produce control data, called <b>hints</b>, which describe
         them to the final renderer.</p>
         
  <li><p><b>Alignment Control</b><br>
         This pass is in charge of scaling the outline, then applying the
         alignment operations described in the <em>hints</em> produced
         beforehand in order to grid-fit it.</p>
</ul>

<p>Traditionally, Feature Detection is performed when the font file is created.
   The hints produced can be stored in many different ways by what is called
   the <em>hinter</em>, which can be a program, a font designer or a
   combination of both (i.e. program computed hints + hand-edited ones).</p>

<p>The final renderer performs the alignment control given the hints provided
   in the font file.</p>

<p>The advantage is that the hints can be very accurate and describe very
   precisely the features and the way they should be grid-fitted. For example,
   the TrueType format simply creates a bytecoded program for each glyph
   outline that is interpreted on the final renderer. The bytecode used is
   a complete virtual processor, specialized in geometric operations.</p>
   
<p>On the other hand, the Type 1 format uses much simpler and shorter hints,
   which forces the final renderer to interpret them more or less liberally.</p>

<a name="auto-hinting"><h3>Automatic Hinting</h3></a>

<p>This project is aiming at the development of an <b>automatic hinting</b>
   module that would include both a feature-detection and alignment control
   pass. Unlike common practice in the industry, we're aiming at <b>real-time
   performance</b>; we also do not want to rely on font-provided and
   format-specific hints that may already be present in the font files.</p>
   
<p>This means that we must select algorithms that are both fast and accurate
   in all phases of development.</p>

<a name="mono-or-aa"><h3>Monochrome or anti-aliased hinting</h3></a>
                  
<p>An important thing to note when considering hinting is the fact that
   generating either monochrome or anti-aliased glyph bitmaps can, and
   more generally should, use distinct algorithms.</p>
   
<p>A good anti-aliasing scan-converter generates a gray-levels image that
   compute the exact outline coverage on each pixel, or an approximation of
   it. These images have much more detail than a monochrome bitmap. Generally,
   many people argue that rendering anti-aliased scaled outlines is sufficient
   and that no additional grid-fitting is needed.</p>
   
<p>However, experience proves that grid-fitting anti-aliased glyphs helps a
   lot by enhancing the contrast of certain glyph features, mainly edges, in
   order to make them more readable. Indeed, most users consider than
   non-hinted anti-aliased outlines are fuzzy and painful to read. For
   example, consider the following image rendered by Acrobat:</p>

<center>An example of bad anti-aliased text<br>
        (text is fuzzy and hard to read at any size)<br>
        <img src="image/bad_aa.png" width=516 height=331></center>

<p>Because anti-aliased outlines carry more detail, they need less adjustment
   to improve their quality. The really hard part is in hinting monochrome
   bitmaps, of course..</p>
