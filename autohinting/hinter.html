<h3>Basic design goals</h3>

<p>The FreeType auto-hinter will be designed in order provide the following
   features:</p>
   
<p><ul>
   <li><p>absolutely patent-free from day 1 !!</p>
   
   <li><p>capable of hinting monochrome and anti-aliased glyphs
          differently, in order to generate high-quality images matched to
          the target device.</p>

   <li><p>capable of real-time hinting of outlines, in order to be used
          with any FreeType 2 font driver ( TrueType, Type 1, CFF/Type 2,
          etc..) that doesn't provide its own hinting algorithm.</p>

   <li><p>we'll try to make the auto-hinter as independent as the rest of
          FreeType 2, in order to make it usable in other projects.</p>

   <li><p>well, as usual with FreeType code, expect small footprint, code
          size and excellent performance ;-)</p>
</ul></p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>The FreeType Auto-Hinter is developed by David Turner, lead FreeType
   architect and developer, under contract with an unnamed company. Among
   other things, the following have been agreed when signing the contract:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li><p>The auto-hinter will be released under an open source license similar
         to the FreeType one (with copyrights reverted to the Company). Hence,
         it will be included in FreeType 2 when the latter is released.</p>
  
  <li><p>The source code for the auto-hinter will be kept confidential until
         the contract delivery date, set to the end of May 2000. However,
         its algorithms will be freely and publicly discussed and detailed
         in a dedicated mailing list. Screen shots of the on-going work will
         be posted on web pages too.</p>
  
</ul></p>

<p>Other than the legal stuff, the general approach is extremely practical,
   and features will be introduced progressively in the auto-hinting engine
   to enhance its quality and performance. Do not expect beautiful results
   immediately then :-)</p>

<p>Of course, the engine will be tested against a large number of fonts.
   However, it will first focus on correctly hinting widely available
   high-quality fonts (Arial, Times, Helvetica, Palatino, Courier, etc..)
   for Latin scripts. Managin ideographs will be added later as these will
   much probably require some specific settings.</p>

<h3>Current Status</h3>

<p>The auto-hinter is now described through several web pages. Please follow
   the links below for more information:</p>

</ul></p>


<h3>ScreenShots</h3>

<p>Here are some screenshots taken on Monday 3 April 2000 with the current
   auto-hinting module. You can find also find old screenshots on the
   <a href="archive/10Mar2000/hinter.html">archives page</a>. Note that :</p>
   
<p><ul>
   <li><p>Glyph metrics are <em>still</em> not hinted in this version, so do
          not be surprised if you see some strange inter-character spacing.
          Composite glyphs (i.e. mainly accented characters) are also not
          hinted correctly as they will be in a near future.</p>

   <li><p>Diagonals are not hinted for now, so don't be surprised to see the
          same "colorful" letters as with TrueDoc.</p>
      
   <li><p>The anti-aliased images correspond to the same grid-fitted outlines than
          the monochrome ones. For now, we do not explicitely support anti-aliased
          hinting, even though this should not prove to be really hard..</p>
      
   <li><p>The anti-aliased images are rendered through Beta FreeType 2's default
          renderer which supports 128 levels of grays (this will go as high as
          256 for the release, but shouldn't make a difference to the human
          eye..).</p>
</ul></p>

<p>The following problems have been fixed compared to the latest version:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li><p>Courier, and ohter fonts with very thin stems were not handled
         properly. This is now fixed.</p>
         
  <li><p>Blue zone computation and alignment have been improved (though it
         doesn't show on the screenshots).</p>
         
  <li><p>Points located between edges are now much better interpolated,
         resulting in slightly higher quality. Actually, the difference
         is more visible with decorative fonts that are not shown there..</p>

  <li><p>Type 1 outlines are now supported. The current results are equivalent
         to the FreeType 2 Type 1 hinter :-) By the way, the latter was
         recently updated with improvements that came from this research.</p>

<h3>Things TO DO !!</h3>

<p>Well, for now: </p>

<p><ul>
  <li><p>Implement composite glyph hinting correctly. FreeType 2 has been
         updated to implement the FT_LOAD_NO_RECURSE flag which is crucial
         to load composite glyphs as separate elements, and I'm currently
         experimenting to incorporate this in the auto-hinter.</p>
  
  <li><p>Introduce extra edges for the left-most and right-most extrema
         in a font (when those are not covered already by an edge). This
         seems to be important for many things, including diagonals !!
         Well, I've just been too lazy for now..</p>
  
  <li><p>Implement anti-aliased hinting (should be easy and give good
         results)</p>
  
  <li><p>Test with asian fonts, and try to devise an algorithm to improve
         their rendering (apparently, equal spacing of white distances is
         much more important than correct positioning of black ones..).</p>
         
  <li><p>Implement outline distortion measurement and optimisation as described
         above.</p>
</ul></p>
