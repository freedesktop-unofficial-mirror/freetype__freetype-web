  <h1 class="section"><a name="what">What is FreeType 1 ?</a></h1>

  <p><font size="+2" color="red">This library is no longer supported.  The
  information given here is for historical interest only.</font></p>

  <p>FreeType&nbsp;1 is a portable and highly efficient TrueType rendering
  engine, that is now successfully used to bring TrueType support to a very
  large variety of platforms and environments, be they font servers,
  graphics libraries or embedded systems.</p>

  <p>FreeType&nbsp;1 is a clean-room implementation that is not derived from
  the original TrueType engine developed by Apple and Microsoft.  It has
  been created with the sole help of the published TrueType specifications,
  which to our great surprise (and pain) turned out to be extremely poor and
  misleading in critical areas.  Much hard work has been undertaken to solve
  ambiguities.  The end result is a portable and fast renderer.</p>

  <p>Note that FreeType&nbsp;1 is a <em>library</em>.  It is <em>not</em> a
  font server for your favorite platform, even though it was designed to be
  used in many of them.  Note also that it is <em>not</em> a complete
  text-rendering library.  Its purpose is simply to open and manage font
  files, as well as load, hint and render individual glyphs efficiently.
  You can also see it as a "TrueType driver" for a higher-level library,
  though rendering text with it is easy, as demonstrated by the test
  programs.</p>

  <p>Its quality matches these of Windows and the Macintosh, while its
  memory foot-print and code size (between 48 and 55&nbsp;kByte of Intel
  code) remain modest.  A thing that cannot be said for most other
  commercial engines available.</p>


  <p>For more information, check our <a href="../download.html">Download
  page</a> or see the source and its diffs through our <a
  href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/freetype/">ViewVC interface</a>.</p>

  <h1 class="section">
    <a name="features">Features</a>
  </h1>

  <p>The following features are part of FreeType&nbsp;1:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Supports TrueType files (TTF) and collections (TTC).  Doesn't
      support GX or OpenType fonts, but these can be opened and used as
      normal TTF files by the library.  (With the exception of <tt>OTF</tt>
      OpenType fonts which really embed a Type&nbsp;1 font file within a
      TrueType storage).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Modular design: Memory and I/O operations can be very easily
      tailored to your own platform/system (the standard release comes with
      ANSI libc support).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Font smoothing, a.k.a. gray-scaling.  Just like Win95, the renderer
      only smoothes the parts of a glyph which need it (i.e., diagonals and
      curves).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Support for all character mappings defined in the TrueType
      specification.  The client application can select whichever pleases
      it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A full-featured and efficient TrueType bytecode interpreter.  The
      engine is able to produce excellent output at small point sizes.  This
      component has been extremely difficult to get right, due to the
      ambiguous and misleadings TrueType specifications.  However, we now
      <em>match</em> Windows and Mac qualities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Written in portable ANSI&nbsp;C (and Pascal, for older
      FreeType&nbsp;1 versions).  Should compile well on all kinds of
      systems (tested on 16, 32 and 64&nbsp;bits processors).  With full
      source code available.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Open Source License.  FreeType can be included in all kinds of
      commercial systems and software.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Provides test programs to "show-off" the library, runnable on the
      following platforms: Dos, Unix, OS/2, Win95, and Amiga.  Any porters
      for other systems are welcome and should contact the developers
      team.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Support for extensions.  These are separately linkable units which
      can be used to enhance the engine's functionalities without
      recompiling it.  They can be written to access additional TrueType
      tables, or even GX and/or OpenType ones (the latter is already
      available).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Kerning support: The TrueType kerning data is available through one
      of the standard extensions that comes in this release.  However, it is
      up to the application to "interpret" the data, as many different
      `formats' are supported.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Support for vertical metrics.  The engine is able to provide client
      applications with vertical glyph metrics if they are found in font
      files (usually in CJKV fonts).  If not present, it synthetizes metrics
      from the horizontal values, ascender, and descender metrics.  This
      means that it is possible to render vertical text correctly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Standard extensions are provided to access and load the glyph names
      in the Postscript table.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1 class="section">
    <a name="requirements">Requirements</a>
  </h1>

  <p>The ANSI&nbsp;C version of the library should compile with no problems
  on a great variety of platforms.  Some ANSI-compliant compilers may
  generate a lot of warnings when compiling it.  These are not ANSI warnings
  and can be safely ignored.  The reference compiler is <tt>gcc</tt> with
  the flags `<tt>-Wall</tt>' (all warnings) and `<tt>-ansi -pedantic</tt>',
  though using it is not a requirement.</p>

  <p>However, the test programs, which are used to demonstrate the engine,
  are more system-specific as they use a tiny graphics sub-system in order
  to display the engine's output on the screen or in a window.  The
  sub-system supports right now the following platforms: Dos, OS/2, X11,
  Win95, and Amiga.  In addition, a platform independent driver for the <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/">Allegro</a> graphics library
  is available.</p>

  <p>FreeType&nbsp;1 comes with a Pascal version that now runs on Borland
  Pascal&nbsp;7 (DOS), fPrint Virtual Pascal (OS/2), FPC (Linux, DOS, OS/2)
  as well as Delphi (16-bit & 32-bit versions).  It is now almost up-to-date
  with the C&nbsp;version, even though it doesn't include extensions.  It is
  located in the <tt>ftpascal</tt> CVS module.</p>
